# Hand-Written-Digit-Recognition
This is a repository with various classifier written in jupyter notebook that works on hand written digits images.The data set can be downloaded

<h4>Hand Written Data Recognition Using Logistic Regression.ipynb</h4>
This is a jupyter notebook that reads images converts them into numpy array using scipy's ndimage and then each digit's pickle file is created
pickle files are easy way to store python objects and also they are very fast to work with.Now the data can be easily load for other scripts as 
well.These data are then fed LogisticRegression classifier using sklearn
